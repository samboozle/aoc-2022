# Advent of Code 2022 

This repository houses my solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenge, written in both Rust and Elixir. This is a work in progress; AOC doesn't conclude until XMas.

### Elixir

I love Elixir. For each daily puzzle `n`, my solution lives in `elixir_solutions/lib/day_{n}.ex`. `elixir_solutions` is a `mix` project, so it can be tested with `mix test` (provided you have Elixir and Erlang installed locally).

### Rust

I love Rust! For each daily puzzle `n`, my solution lives in `rust_solutions/src/solutions/day_{n}.rs`. `rust_solutions` is a `cargo` project, so it can be tested with `cargo test` and run with `cargo run` (provided you have Rust installed locally).
